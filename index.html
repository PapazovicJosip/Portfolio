        <h2>About Me</h2>
    
        <p>My name is <strong>Josip Papazović</strong>, born on October 3, 1999, in the small town of <strong>Našice</strong>, located in the Slavonia region of Croatia. I completed my primary education at <strong>Dora Pejačević Elementary School</strong> in Našice and later graduated from <strong>Isidor Kršnjavi High School</strong>, where I studied as an <strong>Agricultural Technician – General Program</strong> for four years.</p>

    <p>After finishing school, I joined the army and served as an active soldier for <strong>two years</strong> in the <strong>7th Guards Brigade "Puma"</strong>. Following my military service, I briefly worked in the metal industry for a private company. Later, I moved to <strong>Switzerland</strong>, where I started a family with my wife, and together we are raising our two children and building a new life.</p>

    <p>I have always been curious about how technology works, which led me to pursue programming. As a teenager, I spent a lot of time playing video games with friends, which sparked my interest in how games and applications are created.</p>

    <p>So far, I have completed:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Introduction to GPT and its Tools</strong></li>
        <li><strong>Core Java Programming</strong></li>
        <li><strong>HTML and CSS Fundamentals</strong></li>
    </ul>

    <p>Currently, I am enrolled in <strong>PHP Core Programming</strong>, and on <strong>November 1, 2025</strong>, I will begin studying <strong>Frontend JavaScript Development with AI</strong> at <strong>Link Group ITAcademy</strong>.</p>

    <p>Outside of programming, I have a strong background in sports. I played <strong>football (soccer) for 13 years</strong>, trained in <strong>kickboxing for 2 years</strong>, <strong>MMA for 3 months</strong>, and <strong>Muay Thai for 5 months</strong>, sometimes practicing them in parallel.</p>

    <p>This unique mix of discipline from the military, teamwork from sports, and curiosity for technology has shaped me into a motivated and dedicated individual, ready to grow further as a developer.</p>
